# Retail-Analysis-with-Walmart-Data-Project 

## Problem Statement

We have the sales data for 45 different wallmart stores and we are trying to predict the weekly sales of different stores based on variables such as store number, date, temperature, fuel price, unemployment rate etc.

We have used all the different regression machine learning techniques and used the best model along with its hyperparameter tuning for the prediction.

A demo for deployment by taking user-input is also shown in the end of the project for future prediction using the model

The aim of this project is enable category managers of Walmart to check the weekly and monthly sales of the departments. Analysis includes the effect of markdowns on the sales and the extent of effect on the sales by fuel prices, temperature, unemployment, CPI etc. 
Has been analyzed using simple and multiple linear regression models.


## Objective

Understand the dataset and features

Use suitable Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection/Engineering Methods

Fine tune the model and hyper parameters and Finalise the Model

Make the model deployment-ready by giving User-Input provision


## About the dataset

This datset contains data for the weekly sales prediction for one of the leading retail store, Walmart. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart.

**Store** - the store number

**Date**- the week of sales

**Weekly_Sales** - sales for the given store

**Holiday_Flag** - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 ‚Äì Holiday week 0 ‚Äì Non-holiday week

**Temperature** - Temperature on the day of sale

**Fuel_Price** - Cost of fuel in the region

**CPI** ‚Äì Prevailing consumer price index

**Unemployment** - Prevailing unemployment rate

Here our dependent variable or the column which we are trying to predict is Weekly sales and rest are independent variables.

## üåêBusiness problem

The decision makers of Walmart should be able to analyze the effect of various factors affecting the sales of the products in their stores.

## üìùAnalytics Problem

In this problem we have analyzed sales across different departments by store type and created weekly and monthly. We have analyzed the effect of various factors such as temperature, store size, fuel prices, markdown in prices, unemployment and CPI to determine Which factors have a statistical significance in explaining sales in the stores by using simple and multiple linear regression
